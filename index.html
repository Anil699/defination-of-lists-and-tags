1. Lists
Definition: Lists are used in HTML to organize items in a specific order (ordered list) or without a specific order (unordered list).
Types:
Unordered List (<ul>): Displays a bullet list.
Ordered List (<ol>): Displays a numbered list.
List Item (<li>): Each item in the list is defined with an <li> tag.
Example:

<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


2. Tables
Definition: Tables are used to organize data in rows and columns, making it easy to read and compare information.
Components:
Table (<table>): The main container for a table.
Table Row (<tr>): Defines a row in the table.
Table Header (<th>): Defines a header cell, usually bold.
Table Data (<td>): Defines regular cells containing data.
Example:


<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>


3. <details> and <summary> Tags
Definition: The <details> tag creates an expandable and collapsible section. The <summary> tag, used within <details>, acts as the title or label for the section.
Usage: These tags are helpful for hiding additional content and only displaying it upon user interaction.
Example:


<details>
    <summary>Click to see details</summary>
    <p>This content is hidden until you click.</p>
</details>


4. Icons
Definition: Icons are small visual representations of actions, objects, or ideas, used to make interfaces more intuitive.
Usage: Icons can be added using images (<img> tag) or icon libraries (e.g., FontAwesome, Material Icons).
Example with Image:


<img src="image-icon.png" alt="Image Icon" width="20" height="20">



5. Clickable Content
Definition: Clickable content allows users to interact with elements like links and buttons, often used to navigate or trigger actions.
Usage: The <a> (anchor) tag is commonly used for clickable links, which can open new tabs or navigate to other pages.
Example:


<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Click Here</a>



6. HTML Definitions
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard language for creating web pages, used to structure content with tags.
Tags: Elements surrounded by angle brackets (< >) that define how content appears and behaves. 
For example, <p> for paragraphs, <h1> for headings.
Attributes: Properties inside tags that provide additional information, such as href in <a href="URL">, which specifies a link's URL.
